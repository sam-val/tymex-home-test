# Question 1
```
Using Java or Python, implement an idempotency key mechanism for a RESTful API that processes
payment transactions.

Your implementation should:
1. Accept an idempotency key in API requests
2. Store the request and response associated with each idempotency key
3. Return the payment transaction response when the same idempotency key is reused
4. Handle concurrent requests with the same idempotency key correctly
5. Set appropriate expiration for stored idempotency keys
```

# üöÄ Async FastAPI Server

> üí° Built with a modular architecture using a template based on [fastapi-django-like-template (my own repo)](https://github.com/sam-val/fastapi-django-like-template)

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements Fulfilled

### 1. [API accepts `idempotency_id`](#Ô∏è-endpoints)
The `/api/payment/v1/payments` endpoint accepts an `idempotency_id` in the request body to ensure the same request isn‚Äôt processed twice.

### 2. [Stores request and response in a table](#model)
Incoming requests and generated responses are stored in a dedicated `IdempotencyKey` table.

### 3. [Returns cached response on repeated calls](#Ô∏è-endpoints)
If a request is made again with the same `idempotency_id`, the server returns the **original** response instead of processing it again.

### 4. [Handles concurrent requests with the same idempotency key](#handling-of-concurrency-requirement-4)
Are handled by model constraints. 

### 5. [Sets expiration for stored idempotency keys](#expired-idempotency)
Keys older than a configured TTL (e.g., 24 hours) are treated as expired and new requests will overwrite them.

## ‚ú® Features

- Django-style folder layout (`apps/`, `api/`, `config/`)
- Versioned APIs (`v1`, `v2`, etc.)
- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- [`alembic`](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) for database migrations
- [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
- Built-in support for [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/)
- IPython shell (`make shell`) similar to Django's shell
- Developer-friendly `Makefile` commands for common tasks

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start
### Depedencies: `Python3.13`, `poetry`, `make` (for Makefile)

### üîß Install Poetry

If you don't have Poetry, install it using the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). For most systems, this works:

**MacOS/Linux:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3.13 -
```

You may need to restart your shell or manually add Poetry to your PATH. Add the following to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or equivalent:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then restart your terminal and verify it works:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### üîß Init dependencies

```bash
# at root dir
poetry env use python3.13
poetry install --no-root
```

### Run Server

Make migrations (I use SQlite for this exercise for quick setup)

```bash
make upgrade
```

Then start the local server with:

```bash
make run_dev # (with make)
# or
poetry run fastapi dev
```

This will start the server at `localhost:8000`

## üõ†Ô∏è Endpoints 
The server comes with Swagger UI. You can check & play with the APIs docs on: `localhost:8000/docs`

``This api tries to fulfill the requirement. It stores the request & response data (here simplified as string) based on idempotency id.``

### Expired Idempotency

``
If the idempotency expires, it returns 409 since record with same idempotency exists and response is no longer valid
``

### Expiry Time Config
Can be configured in `apps/payments/constants.py`
For this test I make it a small amout of time
```bash
# apps/payments/constants.py
IDEMPOTENCY_EXPIRY_SECONDS = 20
```

### Handling of concurrency (requirement #4)

If there is two (or more) requests happening at the same time, the second request will fail thanks to the DB constraint on the IdempotencyKey table (`idempotency_id is set as primary key`)

## Model
To keep this simple, I make one model, enough to fulfill the requirement

### Idempotency Key
```
class IdempotencyKey(SQLModel, table=True):
    key: str = Field(primary_key=True)
    request_data: str  # for this test, simplify data as string
    response_data: str
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    expires_at: datetime = Field(
        default_factory=lambda: datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=IDEMPOTENCY_EXPIRY_SECONDS)
    )
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Makefile Commands (extra)

Use `make <command>` to run common development tasks:

```make
make run_dev         # Start the FastAPI app
make migrations     # Run Alembic migration files
make upgrade        # Upgrade Alembic migration
make downgrade      # Downgrade Alembic migration
make shell          # Start an interactive shell (IPython)
make test_all       # Run tests with pytest
```

## üß™ Unit Testing

Tests are located in `apps/payments/tests/api/test_api_v1.py`

You can run tests with command:

```bash
make test_all
# or
poetry run pytest -q -rx .
```
